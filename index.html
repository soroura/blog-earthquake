            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The cost of natural disasters now tops <strong>$2.3 trillion</strong> annually, a destructive cycle fueling humanitarian crises. Our health systems face immediate casualties, long-term challenges, and even collapse. However, proactive investment in disaster preparedness is a smart economic move, yielding a <strong>four-dollar return for every dollar invested</strong> in resilient infrastructure. This report dives into how earthquakes and tsunamis impact health, exposes healthcare system weaknesses, examines high-risk regions like the Russian Far East and the Middle East, and offers a roadmap for building resilient healthcare systems.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">The Hidden Price Tag of Earthquakes and Tsunamis on Our Health</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The world is bracing for a future with more frequent and intense disasters. By 2030, we could be seeing 560 disasters a year—that's 1.5 events every single day. And the financial toll is skyrocketing. This isn't just a series of unfortunate events; it's a systemic threat, trapping us in a cycle of disasters, debt, and humanitarian need that could destabilize global finances.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Just yesterday, a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, triggering tsunami waves up to 4 meters and forcing evacuations across the region. This event, considered the sixth strongest ever recorded, caused damage to buildings, including a kindergarten, and resulted in several injuries from individuals rushing to evacuate structures. It also prompted tsunami warnings for distant areas like Japan, Hawaii, and Alaska, underscoring the immediate and far-reaching consequences of such seismic activity.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">Direct costs averaged <strong>$70–80 billion annually</strong> between 1970 and 2000.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Jumped to <strong>$180–200 billion annually</strong> from 2001 to 2020.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">True annual cost (including ripple effects and environmental damage) now exceeds a mind-boggling <strong>$2.3 trillion</strong>.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">By 2030, we could be seeing <strong>560 disasters a year</strong>—that's 1.5 events every single day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">In this challenging landscape, the strength of our health systems is absolutely vital. They are our first line of defense, crucial for saving lives and protecting livelihoods when major shocks like pandemics or natural disasters hit. A health system's ability to prepare, respond, and recover directly impacts the well-being of entire communities. Disasters hit health systems hard, often leading to multi-million dollar losses and undermining their performance. That's why organizations like the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) are shouting from the rooftops: "Resilience Pays!" Investing in preparedness isn't just about doing good; it's about smart economics. The 4:1 return on investment for resilient infrastructure in developing countries proves that ignoring preparedness is simply bad business. This shifts disaster risk reduction from a niche humanitarian concern to a core pillar of national economic planning, aligning perfectly with the broader goals for sustainable development by 2030.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Global Trends: The Human and Economic Toll of Earthquakes and Tsunamis</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The financial impact of natural disasters continues to grow globally. As we've seen, direct costs have surged, and when you add in the wider cascading and ecosystem costs, the world's annual disaster bill now exceeds <strong>$2.3 trillion</strong>. The Global Assessment Report (GAR) 2025 warns that this escalating economic burden is a systemic threat to financial stability, demanding a fundamental rethink of how we understand, finance, and manage risk worldwide.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">But beyond the numbers, there's a profound human story. Between 1998 and 2017, earthquakes alone claimed nearly 750,000 lives globally, more than half of all natural disaster fatalities. Over 125 million people were injured, lost their homes, or were displaced in the immediate aftermath. Most earthquake deaths—about 75%—are a direct result of buildings collapsing. While other factors like landslides, fires, or tsunamis account for the remaining 25%, these secondary events can also lead to incredibly high death tolls. A major culprit in building collapse fatalities, especially in developing nations, is simply poor construction quality. For tsunamis, drowning is the most common cause of death, with injuries from debris creating immediate healthcare needs.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The suffering doesn't end when the shaking stops. Long-term health issues are significant. While widespread epidemics are rare, certain infections often emerge. Skin, diarrheal, and respiratory infections are common among survivors. Water-borne diseases (like cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A/E) and food-borne illnesses are risks for up to a month after a disaster. This is often made worse by overcrowded temporary shelters and damaged water and sanitation systems, which dramatically increase the risk of disease spread. Chronic conditions also worsen, as essential treatments for heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma are interrupted. This shows us that the long-term health burden isn't just from the disaster itself, but a ripple effect of damaged infrastructure, displacement, and broken health services.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The psychological scars are also deep and lasting. Earthquakes and tsunamis leave profound mental health impacts. Studies show that nearly a third of those affected by disasters may experience mental distress, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, with symptoms sometimes lasting for months or even years. Reported PTSD rates can range from 10% to a staggering 50%, while depression rates vary between 5.8% and 54%.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Disasters hit vulnerable populations the hardest, magnifying existing inequalities. People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, older adults, and women often face higher risks of injury and death. For example, older individuals are more prone to fractures, may struggle to evacuate quickly, and often have pre-existing conditions that worsen after a disaster. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, for instance, saw a sharp rise in pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths, especially among those aged 65 and older, particularly in nursing homes and evacuation shelters. Children also face higher risks of specific injuries, like respiratory issues due to smaller airways and crush injuries. Socioeconomic factors like low income, property loss, unemployment, and forced relocation significantly worsen mental health issues among survivors. This unequal impact means effective disaster preparedness must focus on equity, prioritizing interventions for these groups to truly build resilience for everyone.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">It's also important to remember that the true human cost of disasters is often underestimated in immediate reports. "Official" death tolls, like the initial count after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, frequently underrepresent the actual impact. This undercounting happens because resources are stretched thin, it's hard to accurately determine disaster-related deaths, and many health issues only emerge later. This challenge in accurate assessment can hinder proper long-term resource allocation and recovery planning, as the full scope of needs isn't immediately clear.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Health System Vulnerabilities: When Catastrophe Strikes, Where Do We Break?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Major earthquakes and tsunamis brutally expose the weak spots in our health systems, often leading to a domino effect of failures that amplify human suffering.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Cracks in Our Infrastructure: Damage, Functionality, and Access to Care</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Earthquakes and tsunamis don't just cause buildings to collapse; they inflict widespread damage, from structural failures to non-structural issues like fallen ceilings and broken medical equipment, rendering facilities unusable even if the main building stands. The ability of healthcare services to function also relies heavily on resilient "lifelines"—essential services like water, electricity, transport, and communication. Damage to these lifelines can cut off water supplies, disable generators, and disrupt medical supply chains, directly preventing care from being delivered. Imagine roads and bridges destroyed, preventing patients from reaching hospitals and healthcare workers from getting to where they're needed. This shows that a truly "safe hospital" isn't just about its walls; it's about the continuous flow of utilities, supplies, and people. We need to think beyond the building itself to ensure sustained functionality during and after a crisis.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">Overwhelmed and Under-Resourced: The Strain on Emergency Services</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Mass casualty events are an inevitable consequence of major seismic activity, causing the demand for medical services to far outstrip what's available. This often leads to severe hospital overcrowding and can even cause the entire healthcare system to buckle. Even a surge of patients with minor and moderate injuries, which make up the majority of earthquake casualties, can overwhelm emergency departments. Resources—personnel, equipment, and medical supplies—are routinely stretched thin, leading to critical shortages, delays in care, and compromised treatment quality. To make matters worse, healthcare workers themselves often suffer personal losses—damaged homes, lost family members—which can severely impact their ability to report to work, further reducing the capacity of health facilities.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Silence of Disconnection: Communication, Coordination, and Information Breakdowns</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">When communication fails, the disaster's impact multiplies. These breakdowns cause immense frustration, delay emergency service coordination, and severely hinder the timely transport of patients to the right care. System failures, network congestion, and misrouted emergency calls create widespread chaos and inefficiency immediately after a disaster. A lack of synchronization between different emergency services and internal communication gaps between local and external health personnel further complicate crisis management, impeding effective response efforts. While rapid deployment of satellite technology can help, initial communication disruptions severely hamper needs assessments and overall response coordination. This underscores that clear protocols for information flow and reliable communication technologies are just as vital as physical infrastructure in the immediate response phase, as their failure can directly delay life-saving interventions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Invisible Wounds: Community Traumatization and its Impact on Preparedness</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The psychological toll of disasters on communities can significantly hinder their ability to participate in health emergency and disaster risk management (EDRM) efforts. Repeated disaster experiences, combined with negative perceptions of past inefficient responses and a perceived lack of effective EDRM plans, can erode hope and motivation within affected populations. When people feel unsafe, they prioritize immediate, short-term concerns over long-term preparedness. Furthermore, inaccurate, misleading, or biased information from media outlets during disasters can intensify fear, anxiety, and confusion, undermining public trust and reducing community participation in crucial preventive measures. This creates a significant barrier to effective long-term preparedness and recovery. To overcome this, public health disaster preparedness must move beyond top-down directives to genuinely engage communities, build trust through transparent planning, and ensure accurate, empathetic communication to foster collective action and true resilience.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Regional Risk Profiles: Understanding Probabilities and Past Impacts</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Understanding the geographical distribution and probability of seismic and tsunami events is fundamental to effective health preparedness.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Russian Far East (Kamchatka): Historical Events, Current Seismic Activity, and Tsunami Probabilities</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Russian Far East, particularly the Kamchatka Peninsula, is an integral part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and exhibits exceptionally high seismic activity. Historically, this region has experienced powerful events, including a magnitude 9.0 earthquake in 1952. More recently, a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Kamchatka in July 2025 (as referenced in the provided data), triggering tsunami waves up to 4 meters. This event necessitated evacuations, caused damage to buildings (such as a kindergarten), and resulted in several injuries from individuals rushing to evacuate structures. The shallow depth of these earthquakes, exemplified by the 19.3 km depth of the M8.8 quake, significantly increases their potential to generate tsunamis that can impact not only local coastlines but also distant regions across the Pacific, including Japan, Hawaii, and Alaska. This highlights the inherent trans-boundary nature of seismic and tsunami hazards, underscoring the critical need for robust international early warning systems and coordinated response mechanisms to protect widely separated populations.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Middle East and Mediterranean: Seismic and Tsunami Risks, and the Relevance of Global Lessons for Regional Preparedness</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Alpide belt, which extends through the Mediterranean region, Turkey, Iran, and northern India, constitutes the second most seismically active region globally, accounting for 5-6% of all earthquakes. The Mediterranean basin, in particular, is the second highest source of tsunamis worldwide after the Pacific, with 98 large historical tsunamis recorded. On average, a disastrous tsunami occurs in the Mediterranean Sea once every century. A notable projection from UNESCO indicates a near 100% chance of a tsunami occurring in the Mediterranean within the next 30 years. These tsunamis are typically generated by large seismic events (magnitude &gt;6.5) along subduction arcs (e.g., Cyprus, Hellenic, Calabrian), continental transform faults, or triggered by submarine landslides and volcanic eruptions. Recent research has successfully identified the precise underwater rupture (the Amorgos fault) that caused the largest modern Mediterranean tsunami in 1956 (estimated magnitude 7.2-7.8), which generated waves up to 20 meters. While the Pacific often captures more attention, the high historical frequency and the compelling probability of a significant tsunami in the Mediterranean within the near future reveal a substantial, potentially underestimated, risk. This emphasizes the vital importance of leveraging historical and geological evidence, including paleotsunami studies, for comprehensive risk assessment in regions with long human histories but less extensive instrumental data.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Middle East region faces a complex array of challenges, including ongoing humanitarian crises and conflicts that continuously expose populations to infectious disease outbreaks (such as cholera, dengue, and measles) in addition to natural disaster risks. This multi-hazard environment means that seismic and tsunami events in this region would not only cause direct harm but also severely exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, potentially leading to widespread disease outbreaks and further destabilization. This calls for an integrated "humanitarian-development-peace" approach to disaster preparedness that addresses underlying fragilities within the health system and broader societal context. Lessons gleaned from global events, such as the paramount importance of meticulous planning, shared resilience across sectors, continuous enhancement of preparedness measures, and the safeguarding of critical lifelines, are highly pertinent for the Middle East, where health systems are already operating under immense pressure, compounded by fragile water, sanitation, and immunization systems.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Strategies for Building Resilient Health Systems: A Blueprint for the Future</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Effective disaster preparedness in the health sector isn't just about reacting; it's about a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach that builds strength from the ground up, embraces innovation, and fosters wide-ranging collaboration.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">The Need for a Multi-Layered Approach to Health Resilience</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Building true health system resilience requires a strategic, multi-layered approach that moves beyond reactive measures to proactive planning and continuous improvement. This blueprint emphasizes several critical areas:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Robust Risk Assessment:</strong> Countries must utilize all-hazard tools for national risk profiling, such as the WHO's Strategic Tool for Assessing Risk (STAR), which offers a simple yet effective methodology to identify and understand potential threats.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Comprehensive Preparedness and Response Plans:</strong> These plans must be in place and actively developed, gathering all relevant sectors together to ensure national health system resilience in the face of disasters and major emergencies.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Crucial Coordination and Communication Redundancy:</strong> Effective coordination is paramount, supported by robust communication redundancy planning to ensure uninterrupted information flow during crises.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Simulations as the King of Testing:</strong> Regular, realistic simulations are essential for gathering insights and rigorously testing preparedness plans, identifying gaps, and refining response mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">Strengthening the Core: Infrastructure, Funding, Skilled Teams, and Smart Supply Chains</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">To build truly resilient health systems, we need to reinforce a wide range of foundational elements. This means ensuring we have the right equipment, securing stable funding, nurturing a skilled and sufficient workforce, setting up effective information systems, and implementing efficient management and operational procedures. It's not enough to just buy more hospital beds or equipment; true resilience comes from strengthening the underlying systems and the human talent that deliver health services. Without solid funding, well-trained personnel, and smooth operations, physical assets alone won't guarantee functionality during a crisis.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Investing in resilient infrastructure is paramount. This includes prioritizing "safe hospital" construction and upgrading existing facilities to withstand both structural and non-structural damage. Crucially, this investment must also extend to the "lifelines"—water, electricity, transport, and communication systems—because their uninterrupted function is vital for adequate treatment, equitable access to care, and maintaining supply chains. Global studies show that every dollar invested in the resilience of these lifelines yields a four-dollar benefit in the long run. Furthermore, developing local surgical capacity, especially for trauma, neurosurgical, obstetrical, and anesthesia care, is a critical part of disaster risk reduction. National Surgical, Obstetric, and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) can provide a framework for this development.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">Boosting Emergency Preparedness and Response: All-Hazards Planning, Training, and Coordination</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Comprehensive emergency management involves distinct phases: identifying hazards, mitigating risks, preparing, responding, and recovering. Health systems must develop and embed national health emergency and disaster risk management plans that take an "all-hazards" approach and include robust contingency planning. A core aspect of improving response capabilities is identifying and rigorously training multidisciplinary health response teams, including Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs), to ensure timely and effective interventions. Innovative solutions, such as mobile medical units (like BHISMCUBE), are vital for mass casualty situations, capable of setting up fully functional emergency hospitals rapidly at disaster sites. These units, often equipped with RFID-tagged supplies, allow responders to act efficiently within the critical "golden hour" after an event. Training roadmaps should be developed to educate a wide range of frontline responders, including doctors, nurses, police, fire officers, and paramedics.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">Harnessing Innovation: The Power of Digital Health, Data, and Early Warnings</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Integrating digital health technologies (DHTs) isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a transformative necessity for resilient healthcare, especially in rural, remote, and underserved communities. Technologies like telehealth, artificial intelligence (AI), mobile health apps, big data analytics, and drones are becoming essential for providing healthcare under challenging conditions. They can help with patient screening, minimize exposure risks, improve disease modeling, and support vital communication between patients, families, and healthcare workers. Data-driven approaches for coordinated service delivery, combined with enhanced digital communication, can help meet surging demand through system-level and regionally coordinated responses.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">However, despite their potential, significant challenges remain, including the "digital divide" that limits equitable access to health services and the current lack of formal frameworks for effective DHT use in disaster situations. This highlights a critical need for targeted policy development and strategic investment to ensure fair access and effective, standardized deployment of these technologies. Furthermore, robust early warning systems are crucial for disaster prevention and preparedness; even 24 hours' warning of a coming storm or heat wave can reduce damage by 30 percent. International initiatives, like UNESCO's goal to provide tsunami confirmation within 10 minutes or less for high-risk coastlines by 2030, emphasize the importance of rapid alerts. Epidemiological surveillance systems are also vital for real-time identification of injuries and the emergence of communicable and mental health diseases, enabling quick needs assessment and targeted interventions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#007EA7] mb-4">Fostering Collaboration: Health as Part of the Bigger Picture</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Effective health preparedness cannot exist in isolation; it must be deeply integrated within a broader national disaster risk management framework. This requires close coordination between health systems and other emergency management agencies, including the military, civil protection, and community groups, with clearly defined roles and mandates for crisis response. The principle that "resilience is strengthened when it is shared" underscores the necessity of engaging diverse stakeholders across public and private sectors to promote risk-informed decision-making and investment. This holistic approach is critical for ensuring that healthcare services are not only strong internally but also supported by a functional external environment during and after a crisis.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Community engagement and raising risk awareness are fundamental for effective preparedness. This includes providing public information on protective behaviors and evacuation plans. Addressing community traumatization and building trust are also key, as feelings of unsafety and past negative experiences can significantly reduce community participation in preparedness efforts.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Recommendations for Proactive Disaster Preparedness in Health: Our Path Forward</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">To truly lessen the impact of major seismic and tsunami events on our health systems, here are some prioritized actions for governments, health authorities, and international partners:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Invest Smartly in Resilient Infrastructure:</strong> We must prioritize building new "safe hospitals" and upgrading existing ones, ensuring they can withstand both structural and non-structural damage. Equally vital is investing in the "lifelines"—water, electricity, transport, and communication systems—because their uninterrupted function is the bedrock of healthcare delivery.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Stronger Health System Foundations:</strong> Beyond physical buildings, robust health systems need adequate and sustainable funding, a continuously developed and sufficient health workforce, resilient supply chains, and effective information management systems. This also includes boosting local surgical capacity, which is crucial for immediate trauma care.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Embrace Comprehensive Multi-Hazard Planning:</strong> National health emergency and disaster risk management plans must be developed and embedded, adopting an "all-hazards" approach and incorporating detailed contingency planning for various scenarios.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Boost Response Capabilities:</strong> A critical step is identifying and rigorously training multidisciplinary health response teams and Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs). Investing in rapid-response mobile medical units is essential for managing mass casualty situations, alongside comprehensive training roadmaps for all frontline responders.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Harness Technology and Data:</strong> Digital health technologies should be integrated for patient management, communication, and data-driven decision-making. Developing and utilizing epidemiological surveillance systems is crucial for real-time monitoring of health impacts and early detection of disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Fostering Cross-Sectoral Coordination and Community Engagement:</strong> Clear roles and mandates for coordination between health systems and broader emergency management agencies (e.g., military, civil protection) must be established. Prioritizing community risk awareness, public information, and actively addressing factors contributing to community traumatization are essential for fostering collective action and trust.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Address Vulnerability and Equity:</strong> Preparedness strategies must specifically address the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, including the elderly, women, children, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, ensuring equitable access to care and support services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Policymakers must recognize that investing in disaster risk reduction isn't an optional expense; it's an indispensable component for achieving financial stability and sustainable development. Policies should proactively address regulatory gaps, such as the absence of mechanisms for identifying collapse risks in existing healthcare buildings. Furthermore, every disaster offers an invaluable opportunity for learning and adaptation, fostering a continuous culture of improvement in resilience efforts.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#003459] mb-4">Conclusion: A Call to Action for a Safer, More Resilient Future</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The increasing frequency and intensity of seismic and tsunami events, coupled with their profound and cascading impacts on our health systems, demand urgent and sustained global action. The evidence is clear: these disasters inflict not only immediate deaths and injuries but also long-term health challenges, significant psychological trauma, and widespread systemic disruptions that undermine public health and economic stability. The true costs, often underestimated, extend far beyond direct damages, encompassing the erosion of community trust and the exacerbation of pre-existing societal inequalities.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Building health resilience is a complex, multi-faceted journey that goes beyond immediate emergency response. It requires proactive investment in robust and adaptable infrastructure, the cultivation of a skilled and sufficient human resource base, the strategic deployment of innovative technologies, and the establishment of strong, multi-sectoral partnerships. By democratizing our understanding of risk, actively breaking the destructive cycles of disaster and debt, and integrating resilience into every layer of planning and investment—from national policy to local community engagement—we can pave the way for a future where communities are better equipped to withstand shocks, protect their health, and ultimately thrive. The call to action is unequivocal: invest in preparedness, strengthen our health systems, and foster a shared global commitment to a safer, more resilient world for all.</p>
